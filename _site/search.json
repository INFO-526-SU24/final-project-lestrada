It has a total of 4042 observations (rows), and 57 variables (columns).\nI chose this data set because I am an avid coffee drinker and would like to know what other fellow coffee lovers like to drink, and if they spend as much money on coffee as I do. I also used to work at a local Mexican style coffee shop name Tierra Mia in the Los Angles area. Exploring this data set would just give me insight into the community that I would like to have."
