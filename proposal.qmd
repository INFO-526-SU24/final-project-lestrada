#glimpse(coffee_survey)
```

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

The coffee survey was collected during a YouTube event called the "Great American Coffee Taste Test". It has a total of 4042 observations (rows), and 57 variables (columns).

I chose this data set because I am an avid coffee drinker and I used to work at a local Mexican style coffee shop name Tierra Mia in the Los Angles area.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

Q1: Which age group spends the most money on coffee per month?

Q2: What is the favorite kinds of coffee for each age group?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
    -   variables: total_spend, age, favorite. Will have to create a count of total_spend variable per age group and count of favorite drinks per age group.
