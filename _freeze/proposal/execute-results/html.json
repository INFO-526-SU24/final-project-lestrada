It has a total of 4042 observations (rows), and 57 variables (columns).\n\nI chose this data set because I am an avid coffee drinker and I used to work at a local Mexican style coffee shop name Tierra Mia in the Los Angles area.\n\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\nQ1: Which age group spends the most money on coffee per month?\n\nQ2: What is the favorite kinds of coffee for each age group?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n    -   variables: total_spend, age, favorite. Will have to create a count of total_spend variable per age group and count of favorite drinks per age group.\n",
