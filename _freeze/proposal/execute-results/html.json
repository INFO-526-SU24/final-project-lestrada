This event was primairly to taste test 4 different types of coffee, while the entire survey collected a wide variety of information. It has a total of 4042 participants/observations (rows), and 57 variables (columns).\n\n-   I chose this data set because I am an avid coffee drinker and would like to know what other fellow coffee lovers like to drink, and if they spend as much money on coffee as I do. I also used to work at a local Mexican style coffee shop named Tierra Mia in the Los Angles area. Exploring this data set would just give me insight into the community that I would like to have.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\nQ1: Which age group spends the most money on coffee per month?\n\nQ2: What is the favorite kinds of coffee for each age group?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   I am planning on creating either a heat map like plot of the with count as the gradient or stacked bar charts\n-   The variables I need to use are listed below along with the question that was asked to participants in the survey:\n    -   total_spend: In total, how much money do you typically spend on coffee in a month?\n    -   favorite: What is your favorite coffee drink?\n    -   age: What is your age?\n    -   Will have to create a count of total_spend variable per age group and count of favorite drinks per age group.\n\nTask List:\n\n| Task Name    | Status       | Assignee | Due   | Priority | Summary |\n|--------------|--------------|----------|-------|----------|---------|\n| Import Data  | compelte     | luis     | 05/29 | Low      |         |\n| Explore Data | In Progress  | luis     | 06/01 | Moderate |         |\n| Q1           | Not Started  | luis     | 06/03 | High     |         |\n| Q2           | Not Started  | luis     | 06/05 | High     |         |\n| Write Up     | Not Started  | luis     | 06/07 | High     |         |\n| Presentation | Not Started  | luis     | 06/10 | High     |         |\n| Final Review | Not Started  | luis     | 06/15 | Moderate |         |\n",
