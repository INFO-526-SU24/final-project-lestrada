## Introduction and Motivation

-   The coffee survey was collected from people participated in a YouTube event called the "Great American Coffee Taste Test".

    -   This event was primairly to taste test 4 different types of coffee

-   I chose this data set because I am an avid coffee drinker and exploring this data set would give me insight into the community that I would like to have

## The Data

-   The entire survey collected a wide variety of information.

    -   This includes information ranging from favorite type of coffee, where you like to drink coffee, how much money you spend, education level, political affiliation etc...

-   Consist of 4042 participants/observations (rows), and 57 variables (columns) worth of data.

## Main Questions

The two main questions I want to explore in this data set are the following

1.  Started as: Which age group spends the most money on coffee per month?

    -   Turned into: How much money does each age group spend on coffee?

2.  What is the favorite kinds of coffee for each group: gender, education level, employment status, and political affiliations, and ethnicity/race?

## Data Exploration #1 - Age

```{r}
ggplot(coffee_survey)+
  geom_bar(aes(age,fill=age))+ 
  coord_flip(clip = "off")+
  labs(title='age')
```

## Data Exploration #2 - Favorite Coffee

```{r}
ggplot(coffee_survey)+
  geom_bar(aes(favorite,fill=favorite))+ 
  coord_flip(clip = "off")+
  labs(title='favorite')
```

## Data Exploration #3 - Education Level

```{r}
ggplot(coffee_survey)+
  geom_bar(aes(education_level,fill=education_level))+ 
  coord_flip(clip = "off")+
  labs(title='education_level')
```

## Data Exploration #4 - Gender

```{r}
ggplot(coffee_survey)+
  geom_bar(aes(gender,fill=gender))+ 
  coord_flip(clip = "off")+
  labs(title='gender')
```

## Data Exploration #5 - Employment Status

```{r}
ggplot(coffee_survey)+
  geom_bar(aes(employment_status,fill=employment_status))+ 
  coord_flip(clip = "off")+
  labs(title='employment_status')
```

## Visualization 1: Money spent on coffee by age group (1/2)

coffee_survey_calc|>
  ggplot() + 
  aes(age, pct, fill=total_spend)+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",width=0.7, size=0.2)+
  geom_text(aes(label=paste0(sprintf("%1.1f", pct),"%")),
            position=position_stack(vjust=0.5),
            size =6, show.legend = FALSE,fontface = "bold")+
  coord_flip(clip = "off")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdBu")+
  theme(legend.position="top",
        plot.background=element_rect(fill="white", color=NA),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill="white", color=NA),
        panel.grid=element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size=30),
        legend.text = element_text(size=20),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=20))+
  labs(fill="", x="", y="")+
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1,reverse = TRUE))
```

## Visualization 1 - Money spent on coffee by age group (2/2)

-   At face value, the youngest age group has the highest percentage of people that spend \>\$100 per month. This subgroup also has the smallest number of total entries, so its likely just outlier data.

-   Thereafter, the trend appears to be that the older folks get the more they spend on coffee untill about the 55-64 year age group. Accross all groups the most people spend between \$20-\$60 on coffee per month.

        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=15))+
  labs(fill="", x="", y="")

```

## Visualization 2 - Favorite type of coffee: A quick look (2/2)

-   Most people, regardless of education level, employment status, ethincity, Gender or political affiliation drink regular drip coffee, pour overs, or lattes.

    -   A few specific groups have cappuccinos and espresso as a favorite drink.

## ConclusionsÂ 

-   Accross all age groups, most people spend between 20-60 dollars on coffee per month

-   Most people drink regular drip coffee, pour overs, or lattes.

    -   Some specific groups like cappuccinos and espresso as well

With all of the information in the survey, there are many other ways to slice and dice the data. Many other valuable conclusions can likely be drawn
